## Netlify Auth Demo (Gatsby Version)

(talk a bit about 2-sided routing and protection with _redirects and client-side routing with PWAs)

Admin will be an example of a fully protected route, such that the content presumes you're logged in and will redirect you back to index if you're not

Members will be an example of a non-protected route that just well-handles when the user isn't logged in

Both are useful in different cases.


NOTE - app_metadata is not editable by end-user, only admin auth (serverless probably)
user_metadata _is_ editable by end user

both are _visible_ by end user
